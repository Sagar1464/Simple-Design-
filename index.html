        <h1>About Us </h1>
        <p>People have used wood for thousands of years for many purposes, including as a fuel or as a construction material for
             making houses, tools, weapons, furniture, packaging, artworks, and paper. Known constructions using wood date back ten
             thousand years. Buildings like the longhouses in Neolithic Europe were made primarily of wood.</p>
